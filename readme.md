A web scraper written in python, now only for twitter, that offers real time data about the emotional state of the public on a given topic.
It searches a certain tag on twitter, and evaluates each post's reflected emotion. This way we can deduct useful conclusions about the will of the public.
Below are some images of the produced graphs:
